## History
I currently work as a Software Engineer at Microsoft, working on the
[Azure Migrate Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/azure-migrate/).
I get to maintain and design high-reliability large scale systems to help users
to assess and move their on-premise workloads to Microsoft Azure.

I did my undergraduate studies from BITS Pilani, majoring in Computer Science.
I was a member of BITS-ACM, where I got to learn from highly dedicated and
intelligent people.
<br>During these four years, I also learned valuable life lessons which had a
deep impact and helped me grow as a person.
<!-- TODO -->
<!-- <br>[my life at BITS]() -->

I volunteer with Sugar Labs, a non-profit educational initiative, as an
Oversight Board member and by mentoring in programs like Google Summer of Code
and Google Code-In.


## Resrearch Interests & Projects
I am interested in Systems and Networking. Most of the projects I'm working on
are premature to talk about. Broadly, they revolve around P4, Linux TCP, and
Julia.

Some of the other fun stuff that I worked on,
 * Hyperloop India - Building the pod for SpaceX Global Challenge Finals
 * Finding efficient heuristic solutions to mCluTOP
 * Designing object-aware variation of the Seam Carving algorithm
 * Parchment - a Jekyll theme that this blog is built on
 * BOB - a chatbot to answer BITSians' queries


## Non-technical
I like to read comic strips and play Frisbee. I sometimes practice singing and
making Dilbert strips, but I'm not good in either of them yet. I like reading
others' life experiences since it helps in refining my thought process and goals.

Personality traits:<br>
I am an introvert, but I'm trying to change that so as to improve my
interpersonal skills. I tend look at situations with a critical view, focusing
on flaws more than appreciating the goodness. I have a constant fear of
failing; and while it pushes me to work hard, I give up too quickly at times
(I'm trying to improve this).


## Goals
Broad and long-term,
 * Make ground-breaking impact in Networks and Systems, which should lead to
 improved quality of life in some form.
 * Regularly build software which directly helps people around me.

Words I hope to live by (derived from life events, put in an LRU queue),
 * Work hard, so that you feel proud when you look back in life.
 * Always hold your word, no matter what happens.
 * Be kind and respect everyone, you don't know the battles they're fighting.


## The Skipped Breakpoint
This site is built using GitHub Pages, source
[here](https://github.com/pro-panda/pro-panda.github.io).

The blog title came up when I was unable to root cause a bug even while using a
debugger. I blog about what I'm learning / working on. I sometimes write about
life experiences which had a fundamental impact on me.

I made multiple attempts to maintain a blog, but ended up not liking the content
I wrote in the past, or the blog theme. I expect this one to last.
