## History
I currently work as a Software Engineer at Microsoft, working on the
[Azure Migrate Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/azure-migrate/).
I get to maintain and design high-reliability large scale systems to help users
to assess and move their on-premise workloads to Microsoft Azure.

I did my undergraduate studies from BITS Pilani, majoring in Computer Science.
I was a member of BITS-ACM, where I got to learn from highly dedicated and
intelligent people.
<br>During these four years, I also learned valuable life lessons which had a
deep impact and helped me grow as a person.
<!-- TODO -->
<!-- <br>[my life at BITS]() -->

I volunteer with Sugar Labs, a non-profit educational initiative, as an
Oversight Board member and by mentoring in programs like Google Summer of Code
and Google Code-In.


## Resrearch Interests & Projects
I am interested in Networks, Operating Systems and Cloud Infrastucture.<br>
Most of the projects I'm working in this domain are premature to talk about.
Broadly, they revolve around SDN, P4, Linux TCP, and Julia.

Some of the fun stuff that I worked on in the past,
 * Parchment - a Jekyll theme that this blog is built on
 * BOB - a chatbot to answer BITSians' queries
 * OASC - a variation of the Seam Carving algorithm


## Non-technical
I like to play Frisbee. I sometimes try to sing, but I'm not good at it.
I like to read about peoples' life experiences and challenges, since it broadens
my views and allows me to validate (or modify) my life goals.

Personality traits:<br>
I am an introvert, but I've been trying to change that so as to improve my
interpersonal skills. I usually look at situations with a critical view - and
tend to focus on flaws than appreciate the goodness. I have a constant fear of
failing in what I do; and while it pushes me to work hard, I give up at times
(I'm working on fixing that).


## The Skipped Breakpoint
This site is built using GitHub Pages, source
[here](https://github.com/pro-panda/pro-panda.github.io).

The blog title came up when I was unable to root cause a bug even while using a
debugger. I blog about what I'm learning / working on. I sometimes write about
life experiences which had a fundamental impact on me.

I made multiple attempts to maintain a blog, but ended up not liking the content
I wrote in the past, or the blog theme. I expect this one to last.
