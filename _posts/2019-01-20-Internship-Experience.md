## Technical skills required
```
DSA >> OOP ~~ DBS > OS
```

## Resources
1. [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) is comprehensive
   and highly structured. It covers every DSA topic and has
   various solutions for each problem. It also has sections for
   System Design, Puzzles, DBs, etc.
2. [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) has a long
   list of interview experience rounds.
3. [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and
   [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/) are useful
   for OOP, DBMS, and OS topics.

## Preparing your Resume
Your resume is a brief for the interviewer about you. It should
highlight only what is relevant to the interviewer. Write points
which showcase your technical skills (eg: coding projects, SOPs,
past internships, TAships). Extra Curricular Activities (clubs,
sports, etc) don't matter, and can be avoided.<br>
Don't sugar coat, write things as they are. It is possible that
you might have a very small resume. Don't fret over it. Most
companies don't care much about your resume, unless they have a
resume shortlisting round.<br>
See [my resume](https://pro-panda.github.io/resume.pdf) to get an
idea of how to make one.


## Coding Rounds
This is where most of the action happens! Usually, if you are able
to solve 2 out of 3 questions, you're in for the interviews.<br>
Coding rounds are usually 2 - 3 hours long. During my year,
companies held their coding rounds on,
 - HackerRank: Uber, D.E. Shaw, Arcesium and Goldman Sachs
 - Cocubes: Microsoft and Samsung

\* Cocubes supports only C, C++ or Java. Other companies didn't
   have any language restrictions.

There are 2 - 3 questions to test your DSA skills. In addition
to the DSA questions,
 - AppDynamics had DBMS, aptitude, and OOP questions.
 - Goldman Sachs had Aptitude and Analytical questions.
 - Arcesium had Aptitude questions.

BEWARE: Don't rely on last minute preparations / revisions. We
had upto 4 coding rounds in a day, with no breaks.

## Interviews
Your interview would usually start off with a brief discussion
about yourself, followed by technical questions.<br>
While solving a question, keep the interviewer in sync with your
approach. Don't overdo this to an extent that it hinders your
thinking. For an DSA heavy question, state the time and space
complexity of your solution. Then proceed to find a better
solution, or prove why this is an efficient solution. Interviewers
appreciate if you are able to drive yourself to look for more
efficient solutions. Based on the interviewer's reaction, judge
whether you should explain more approaches or solutions.

Some general guidelines,
 - Never lie in the interview.
 - Don't clarify your mistakes.
 - Discuss, but don't argue.
 - Don't ask questions like "What does your company do?". You
   should be knowing that if you are sitting for an interview
   with them.
 - Don't be in a hurry to answer. You might face questions
   which require 10+ minutes to solve and answer.
 - Specific to BITS, interviews can go till 3 AM (starting
   afternoon), and you might not be able to get out in between.
   Keep some snacks and water with you. Keep your phone charged.
 - Ask other candidates about the questions being asked. You
   can expect questions on a similar pattern.

## Personal Experience
I gave coding rounds for 6 companies; Uber, D.E. Shaw,
Microsoft, Arcesium, AppDynamics, Goldman Sachs. I got
selected for the next round in Microsoft, Arcesium and
AppDynamics.<br>

\* TR == Technical Round
1. **Arcesium**
 - TR 1: 16 students called. My interview started with a
   discussion of my GSoC project, past Internship and SOP.
   I was asked standard questions from DBMS, on similar lines
   of round 2 of [this interview](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arcesium-interview-experience-set-1/).
   These questions were followed by their applications, and
   more questions were built on top of it. Other students
   were also asked on one of the three topics, DBMS, DSA or OOP.
 - TR 2: 8 students called. I was questioned on OOP. It was
   a standard text book round up, covering all topics.
 - TR 3: 4 students called. It was more like an HR round. I
   was given puzzles, and asked aptitude based questions.
 - TR 4: 4 students called. I was given 2 DSA questions to
   solve. I hurriedly tried to solve the first one and ended
   up taking too much time and attempts.
 - <span class="blueh">Result:</span> 2 students were finally
   selected, I wasn't in them.

2. **AppDynamics**
 - TR 1: My resume was discussed (SOP and GSoC). 1 DSA Question
   and one maths puzzle. Solved both.
 - TR 2: 1 DSA Question was given. Solved it.
 - <span class="blueh">Result:</span> 2 students were finally
   selected, I wasn't in them.

3. **Microsoft**
 - GSoC and my semester project was discussed in all three
   rounds. All of them had 1 DSA question, which had to be written
   on paper in C.
 - TR 1: The question was a simple one on matrix manipulation. Further
   questions involving solutions of varying time and space complexity
   were built over it. I kept on discussing the approach while I
   worked on the problem.
 - TR 2: The question to finding longest path in a tree. My algorithm
   was correct, but I was unable to write an error free code on paper.
   We went through two dry runs and my code didn't work in both of them.
 - TR 3: The question was based on bit manipulation and data storage.
   I was able to solve the question and write the C code. The interviewer
   was satisfied.
 - <span class="blueh">Result:</span> 12 students were finally
   selected, I was in them.

## FAQs
1. Does GPA matter ?
  * A GPA of 7.0 / 10.0 is a minimum to sit for internship drive at BITS.
    Companies usually focus more on your technical skills than your resume.
    Resume shortlisting rounds if any, might focus on your GPA. From what
    I've heard, some Day 2 companies look at your GPA. For eg, students with
    a GPA of 9+ were allowed relieved from the group fly round in Samsung.

2. Does my majoring branch matter ?
* Yes. Some companies allow only circuit branches to sit for their tests. Otherwise, there is almost no bias.

3. I did not get an Internship via the on-campus drive. What should I do ?
* There are plenty of opportunities to get an off-campus internship. Start
  off by making a list of companies you want to try for. Follow the career
  pages of these companies to look for openings, and keep on applying. You
  can(read must) look for alums or people you know who work there, and ask
  them for a referral. A referral would surely increase your chances of
  getting selected.
