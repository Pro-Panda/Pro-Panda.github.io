## Technical skills required
```
DSA >> OOP ~~ DBS > OS
```

## Resources
1. [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) is comprehensive
   and highly structured. It covers every DSA topic and has
   various solutions for each problem. It also has sections for
   System Design, Puzzles, DBS, etc.
2. [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) has a long
   list of interview experience rounds.
3. [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and
   [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/) are useful
   for OOP, DBMS, and OS topics.

## Preparing your resume
Interviewers skim through your resume to understand your skills.
Write points which showcase your technical skills (eg: coding
projects, past internships, TAships). Extra curricular
activities (clubs, sports, etc) don't matter.<br>
Don't sugar coat; write things as they are. You might have a very small resume; Don't fret over it. Most
companies don't care about your resume, unless they have a resume shortlisting round.<br>
Here is a copy of my [old resume](../assets/old-resume.pdf).


## Coding Rounds
Coding rounds are 2 - 3 hours long, and typically have 2 - 3 DSA questions. In addition
to the DSA questions,
 - AppDynamics had DBMS, aptitude, and OOP questions.
 - Goldman Sachs had aptitude and analytical questions.
 - Arcesium had aptitude questions.

During my year, companies held their coding rounds on,
 - HackerRank for Uber, D.E. Shaw, Arcesium and Goldman Sachs
 - Cocubes for Microsoft and Samsung

\* Cocubes supports only C, C++ and Java. Other platforms supported
   most languages.

Usually, solving 2 out of 3 questions can get you through the coding round,
but it depends on the difficulty of questions.

Specific to BITS, these rounds can get hectic. We had 4 coding rounds together for day-1, with no breaks.

## Interviews
Typically, interviews start off with a brief discussion
about yourself, followed by technical questions.<br>
While solving a question, keep the interviewer in sync with your
approach. Don't overdo such that it hinders your thinking.
For a DSA heavy question, state the time and space
complexity of your solution. Then proceed to find a better
solution, or prove why this is an efficient solution. 

Some obvious guidelines,
 - Never lie in the interview (in life as well xD).
 - Don't clarify your mistakes. Improvise, Adapt, Overcome.
 - Don't ask questions like "What does your company do?". You
   should be knowing that if you are sitting for an interview
   with them.
 - Don't be in a hurry to answer. You might face questions
   which require 10+ minutes to solve; the interviewer knows
   that and does not expect an immediate response.
 - Ask other candidates what questions were asked. You
   can expect questions on a similar pattern.
 - Interviewers appreciate if you are able to drive yourself
   while solving the question.

\* Specific to BITS, interview rounds can go till ~3 AM (starting
   afternoon), and you might not be able to step out in between.
   Have some food supplies with you. Keep your phone charged.

## My Experience
I gave coding rounds for 6 companies; Uber, D.E. Shaw,
Microsoft, Arcesium, AppDynamics, Goldman Sachs. I got
selected for the next round in Microsoft, Arcesium and
AppDynamics. Most of the questions asked were straight
from GeeksForGeeks and InterviewBit.<br>

1. **Arcesium**
 - TR 1: 16 students called. My interview started with a
   discussion of my GSoC project, past internship and research
   project.
   I was asked standard questions from DBMS, similar to
   round 2 of [this interview](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arcesium-interview-experience-set-1/).
   These questions were followed by their applications, and
   more questions were built on top of it. Other students
   were also asked on one of the three topics, DBMS, DSA or OOP.
 - TR 2: 8 students called. I was questioned on OOP. It was
   a standard text book round up, covering all topics.
 - TR 3: 4 students called. Mine was more like an HR round. I
   was given puzzles, and asked aptitude based questions.
 - TR 4: 4 students called. I was given 2 DSA questions to
   solve. I hurriedly tried to solve the first one and ended
   up taking too much time and attempts.
 - <span class="blueh">Result:</span> 2 students were
   selected, I wasn't in them. Probably due to poor performance
   in TR 4.

2. **AppDynamics**
 - TR 1: My resume was discussed (Semester Project and GSoC). 1 DSA Question
   and one maths puzzle was given. Solved both.
 - TR 2: 1 DSA Question was given. Solved it.
 - <span class="blueh">Result:</span> 2 students were
   selected, I wasn't in them. I'm not sure why. Maybe due to relative
   performance.

3. **Microsoft**
 - GSoC and Semester Project was discussed in all three
   rounds. All of them had 1 DSA question, which had to be written
   on paper in C.
 - TR 1: It was a simple question on matrix manipulation. Further
   questions involving variations of time and space complexity
   were built over it.
 - TR 2: The question to finding longest path in a tree. My algorithm
   was correct, but I was unable to write an error free code on paper.
   We went through two dry runs and my code didn't work in both of them.
 - TR 3: The question was to convert data stored in blocks of size X into
   blocks of size Y. I was able to solve the question and write the C code.
 - <span class="blueh">Result:</span> 12 students were
   selected, I was in them.

## FAQs
1. **Does GPA matter ?**
  * Yes. Most companies have a GPA cutoff of 7 for appearing in their recruitment
    drive. A few may have 7.5 or 8. Resume shortlisting rounds if any, primarily judge you on your GPA and
    projects.

2. **Does my majoring branch matter ?**
* Yes. Some companies allow only circuit branches to sit for their tests. Otherwise, there is almost no bias.

3. **I did not get an Internship via the on-campus drive. What should I do ?**
* Start by making a list of companies you want to try for. Follow the career
  pages of these companies to look for openings. Look for alums or people
  you know who work there, and request for a referral. A referral would increase your chances of getting
  called for an interview.
