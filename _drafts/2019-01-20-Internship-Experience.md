## Technical skills in decreasing order of priority:
DSA >> OOP > DBMS > OS

## Resources for preparation:
 - InterviewBit and Geeksforgeeks for DSA Questions
 - GeeksForGeeks and TutorialsPoint for OOP, DBMS and OS revision

## dos and don'ts in chronological order of Internship rounds:
1. Resume: 
Prepare your resume carefully. DON'T lie or exaggerate.  Make sure you have a thorough knowledge of what you are writing. Write things that matter; coding projects, SOPs, previous internships, TAships. Most companies don't seem to care about extra curricular activities (clubs, deptts, etc).

2. Coding Rounds:
Uber, DE Shaw, Arcesium, Goldman Sachs had coding round on HackerRank.
Microsoft had its coding round on Cocubes (which allows only C, C++ or Java).
Uber, DE Shaw and Microsoft had 2  / 3 coding questions to test your DSA Skills. Apart from DSA Questions, AppDynamics also had DBMS, aptitude, and OOP Questions. Goldman Sachs also had Aptitude and Analytical Questions. Arcesium also had aptitude based questions.
Practising questions on competitive coding is ESSENTIAL to do well in this round.

3. Interviews:
DON'T lie in the interview. If you are not sure about a technical answer, say that you are not sure. Be confident while answering questions.
While solving a question, keep the interviewer in sync with your approach. Don't overdo this to an extent that it hinders your thinking. For every question re DSA, also mention the time and space complexity for your solution, and try to think on how you can improve them. Based on the interviewer's reaction, judge whether you should explain more approaches or solutions.
DON'T clarify for your mistakes. Discuss but don't argue. DON'T ask interviewers questions such as "What does your company do?" or "What is your role at the company?". DON'T be in a hurry to answer. Think your answer very carefully before giving the final answer.
Interviews can go till 3AM, after starting from 5PM. Keep some food and water. Keep your phone charged.
Ask other candidates about the questions they are asked. You can expect questions on a similar pattern, though that is not always the case

## Personal Experience:
I gave coding rounds for 6 companies (Uber, D.E. Shaw, Microsoft, Arcesium, AppDynamics, Goldman Sachs). I got selected in Microsoft, Arcesium and AppDynamics.

Arcesium Interview:
 - Technical Round 1: 16 students were called. My resume was discussed at the start (GSoC, past Internship and SOP). I was questioned on DBMS, mostly based on our coursework. There were a few application based DBMS questions at the end. Other students were asked on one out of DBMS, DSA or OOP.
 - Technical Round 2: 8 students were called. I was questioned on OOP (standard course book questions)
 - Technical Round 3: 4 students were called. I was given puzzles and aptitude based questions
 - Technical Round 4: 4 students were called. I was given 2 DSA questions to solve. I hurriedly tried to solve the first one and ended up taking too much time and attempts.
 - 2 students were finally selected, I wasn't in them.

AppDynamics Interview:
 - Technical Round 1: My resume was discussed (SOP and GSoC). 1 DSA Question and one maths puzzle. Solved both.
 - Technical Round 2: 1 DSA Question was given. Solved it.
 - 2 students were finally selected. I wasn't in them. I have no idea how they evaluated us in the second round

Microsoft Interview:
GSoC and SOP was discussed during all three interviews. All three interviews had 1 DSA Question and it was told to write the code on paper in C.
 - Technical Round 1: The question was based on matrices. I was asked to improve once on the space complexity and then on the time complexity. I kept on discussing the approach while I worked on the problem.
 - Technical Round 2: The question was on finding longest path in a tree. Writing code on paper was difficult and I wasn't satisfied with my answer at then end.
 - Technical Round 3: The question was based on bit manipulation and data storage.
