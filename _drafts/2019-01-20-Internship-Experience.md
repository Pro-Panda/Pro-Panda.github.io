## Technical skills vs Priority:
```
DSA >> OOP > DBS > OS
```

## Resources:
1. [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) is comprehensive and highly structured. It covers every DSA topic and has various solutions for each problem. It also has sections for System Design, Puzzles, DBs, etc
2. [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) has a long list of interview experience rounds.
3. [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/) are useful for understanding OOP, DBMS, and OS concepts
 - InterviewBit and GeeksforGeeks for DSA Questions
 - GeeksForGeeks and TutorialsPoint for OOP, DBMS and OS

## Do's and Don'ts for Internship Rounds:
1. Resume:

   1.1 Write down points which showcase your technical skills, 
       eg: coding projects, SOPs, past internships, TAships.
   1.2 Write things as they are. Don't sugar coat.
       Inter
Extra Curricular Activities (clubs, sports, etc) don't matter, and can be avoided.
It is possible that you might have a very small resume. Most companies don't care, unless they have a resume shortlisting round.

2. Coding Rounds:
Companies host their coding rounds on platforms like,
 - HackerRank: Uber, D.E. Shaw, Arcesium and Goldman Sachs
 - Cocubes: Microsoft and Samsung
 \* Cocubes supports only C, C++ or Java

Uber, DE Shaw and Microsoft had 2 to 3 DSA focused questions.
Apart from standard DSA Questions,
 - AppDynamics also had DBMS, aptitude, and OOP Questions.
 - Goldman Sachs also had Aptitude and Analytical Questions.
 - Arcesium also had aptitude based questions.

3. Interviews:
DON'T lie in the interview. Let the interviewer know 
While solving a question, keep the interviewer in sync with your approach. Don't overdo this to an extent that it hinders your thinking.
For an algorithmic question, state the time and space complexity of your solution. Then proceed to find a better solution, or prove why this is an efficient solution. Interviewers appreciate if you are able to drive yourself to look for more efficient solutions. 
Based on the interviewer's reaction, judge whether you should explain more approaches or solutions.

Some general tips,
 - DON'T clarify your mistakes.
 - Discuss, but don't argue.
 - Don't ask questions like "What does your company do?". You should be knowing that if you are sitting for an interview with them
 - DON'T be in a hurry to answer. You might face questions which require 10+ minutes to answer.
 - Specific to BITS, Interviews can go till 3AM (starting afternoon), and you might nsot be able to get out in between. Keep some snacks and water with you. Keep your phone charged.
 - Ask other candidates about the questions being asked. You might expect questions on a similar pattern.

4. HR:

## Personal Experience:
I gave coding rounds for 6 companies (Uber, D.E. Shaw, Microsoft, Arcesium, AppDynamics, Goldman Sachs). I got selected for the next round in Microsoft, Arcesium and AppDynamics.

Arcesium Interview:
 - Technical Round 1: 16 students were called. My resume was discussed at the start (GSoC, past Internship and SOP). I was questioned on DBMS, mostly based on our coursework. There were a few application based DBMS questions at the end. Other students were asked on one out of DBMS, DSA or OOP.
 - Technical Round 2: 8 students were called. I was questioned on OOP (standard course book questions)
 - Technical Round 3: 4 students were called. I was given puzzles and aptitude based questions
 - Technical Round 4: 4 students were called. I was given 2 DSA questions to solve. I hurriedly tried to solve the first one and ended up taking too much time and attempts.
 - 2 students were finally selected, I wasn't in them.

AppDynamics Interview:
 - Technical Round 1: My resume was discussed (SOP and GSoC). 1 DSA Question and one maths puzzle. Solved both.
 - Technical Round 2: 1 DSA Question was given. Solved it.
 - 2 students were finally selected. I wasn't in them. I have no idea how they evaluated us in the second round

Microsoft Interview:
GSoC and SOP was discussed during all three interviews. All three interviews had 1 DSA Question and it was told to write the code on paper in C.
 - Technical Round 1: The question was based on matrices. I was asked to improve once on the space complexity and then on the time complexity. I kept on discussing the approach while I worked on the problem.
 - Technical Round 2: The question was on finding longest path in a tree. Writing code on paper was difficult and I wasn't satisfied with my answer at then end.
 - Technical Round 3: The question was based on bit manipulation and data storage.

For any feedback that I receive, I'll keep on adding questions to the FAQ

## FAQs:
1. Does GPA matter ?
   - Sometimes. Resume shortlisting round might focus on your GPA. From what I've heard, some Day-2 companies look at your GPA even in the future rounds.
