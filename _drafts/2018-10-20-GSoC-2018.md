## What is GSoC ?
 - Google Summer of Code is a global program under which Google
   pays students to work on a three month programming project with
   an open source organization during their break from university.
 - These organisations provide mentors who guide students through
   the entire process

## Advantages of participating in GSoC
 - You get to contribute to something real; I worked on a learning
   platform for students, and had 3,000,000+ users
 - You get to learn things you would otherwise not be able to learn
 - Getting accepted for GSoC is a proof of your ability
 - You get to work with great people
 - The money ($2400, but it varies ) and a T-shirt.

## Disadvantages of participating in GSoC
 - You'll spend 3 months during GSoC and at least 2 months preparing
   for it. There are better things to do if you donâ€™t like software
   development
 - It can affect your grades. I missed many classes to work for my
   organisation

## Choosing an organisation
